Let's see how we can use different features of the PDF editor.


### Create New PDF File ###

You can create new PDF files using HTML5 PDF Editor. Use the "Create New File" menu item as shown below to create a new PDF file:

![https://i1.code.msdn.s-msft.com/pdf-editor-to-edit-pdf-5fb73b8d/image/file/133601/1/new.png](https://i1.code.msdn.s-msft.com/pdf-editor-to-edit-pdf-5fb73b8d/image/file/133601/1/new.png)


After pressing the "Create New File" menu item, a new PDF file with one empty page is created and loaded in the editor as shown below:

### Load and View PDF File ###

We can use the editor to upload the existing PDF file. We can upload the files both from local machine and Dropbox as shown in the below image:

![https://i1.code.msdn.s-msft.com/pdf-editor-to-edit-pdf-5fb73b8d/image/file/133604/1/new.png](https://i1.code.msdn.s-msft.com/pdf-editor-to-edit-pdf-5fb73b8d/image/file/133604/1/new.png)


We will choose the file from Dropbox by clicking the menu item "Open From Dropbox" and a popup will appear to select the file from Dropbox as shown below:

### Sign PDF using Free Hand Drawing Tool ###

Now, you can draw the signatures on PDF file using the Drawing tool. To sign the document, select the "Signature" tool as shown below:

### Load and Fill Form Fields in PDF File ###

We can load a PDF file with form fields in the similar fashion as we have described above. Currently, we support the following form fields:

  * Textbox

### Append / Merge PDF Files ###

After loading the file, now we will perform different operations on the PDF file. First, let's see how we can append another PDF file to our loaded PDF file. For that, we will use the Append File button to upload the file as shown below:

You can download the sample application and try it at your end.  The complete source code is available and you can use it to further modify the application as per your needs. You can also suggest any changes and we will try to implement them.

Note: I am using a free trial license of Aspose.Pdf for .NET in the application which removes any trial limitations of Aspose.Pdf API. You can also get a [free trial license](http://goo.gl/AxGy9H) to further explore the features of Aspose.Pdf API as per your requirement. In case no license file is used, the application will work in evaluation mode and will have some restrictions. So, it is recommended to have a free trial license (without any credit card information requirement or any payment).

In evaluation version (without the use of a free trial license or paid subscription of Aspose.Pdf for .NET) only 4 items from any of the collections will be loaded in the editor. Following warning message will be shown in such case:

![https://i1.code.msdn.s-msft.com/pdf-editor-to-edit-pdf-5fb73b8d/image/file/132105/1/license.png](https://i1.code.msdn.s-msft.com/pdf-editor-to-edit-pdf-5fb73b8d/image/file/132105/1/license.png)

In such case, please get a free trial license to test the HTML5 PDF Editor without any evaluation restrictions as mentioned above.
